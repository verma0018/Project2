        <h2>How to Start Your Journey In Data Science(A step-by-step guide)</h2>
        <div class="text">
          <p>So how do you start to learn data science? The response to this question tends to be a long list of courses to take and books to read, starting with linear algebra or statistics. I went through this myself a few years ago when I was learning. I had no programming background, but knew that I wanted to work with data.

            I can’t fully explain how immensely demotivating it is to be given a huge list of resources without any context. It’s akin to a teacher handing you a stack of textbooks and saying “read all of these.” I struggled with this approach when I was in school. If I had started learning data science this way, I never would have kept going.

            <strong>1. Learn to love data <br></strong>
            <p> 
Nobody ever talks about motivation in learning. Data science is a broad and fuzzy field, which makes it hard to learn. Really hard. Without motivation, you’ll end up stopping halfway through and believing you can’t do it. When this happens, the fault isn’t with you — it’s with the teaching.

You need something that will motivate you to keep learning, even when it’s midnight, the formulas are starting to look blurry, and you’re wondering if neural networks will ever make sense.

You need something that will help you find the linkages between statistics, linear algebra, and neural networks. Something that will prevent you from struggling with the “what do I learn next?” question. You need motivation. Not in the form of an inspiring quote, but in the form of a passion project you can use to drive your learning.

  2. Learn data science by doing</strong><br>
<p>

Learning about machine learning, neural networks, image recognition, and other cutting-edge techniques is important. But most data science doesn’t involve any of it. As a working data scientist:

90% of your work will be data cleaning.
Knowing a few algorithms really well is better than knowing a little about many algorithms. If you know linear regression, k-means clustering, and logistic regression well, can explain and interpret their results, and can actually complete a project from start to finish with them, you’ll be much more employable than if you know every single algorithm, but can’t use them.
Most of the time, when you use an algorithm, it will be a version from a library. You’ll rarely be coding your own SVM implementations — it takes too long.</p>

<strong>3. Learn to communicate insights</strong><br>
<p>
  
Data scientists constantly need to present the results of their analysis to others. Doing this well this can be the difference between an being an okay data scientist and a great one. Data analysis is typically only valuable in a business context if you can convince other people at your company to act on what you found, and that means learning to communicate data.

Part of communicating insights is understanding the topic and theory — you’ll never be able to explain to others something that you don’t understand yourself. Another part is understanding how to clearly organize your results. The final piece is being able to explain your analysis clearly.
